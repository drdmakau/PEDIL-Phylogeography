# PEDIL-Phylogeography

This repository contains BEAST XML configuration files and related resources used for phylogeographic analyses of transboundary and endemic diseases, maintained by the **Population & Epidemiology Data Innovation Lab (PEDIL)**.

Our goal is to promote transparency, reproducibility, and regional collaboration in molecular epidemiology and spatial phylodynamics, with a focus on high-priority animal and zoonotic pathogens.

**Abstract:**  
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious viral infection affecting cloven-hoofed animals, has significant implications for global livestock production and trade. In this study we aimed to characterize and describe dispersal patterns and factors affecting pool 4 serotypes of FMD viruses (FMDV) in the East and Horn of Africa. The study area included 12 countries; 1,423 VP1 sequence data were used (serotypes A, O, SAT1, SAT2) obtained from NCBI GenBank. Using continuous and discrete space phylogeographic models in BEAST, we assessed viral dispersal, population dynamics, direction and velocity modeled against environmental, human and livestock demographic and trade data. We identified distinct viral clusters with Kenya and Sudan as major sources for intercountry spread. Our results underscore the importance of data-driven regional collaboration for outbreak prediction and control.
